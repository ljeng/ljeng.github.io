				Hi, I'm Lareine. I'm a research engineer at an artificial intelligence company in San Francisco developing algorithms in computer vision and augmented reality.

				I coached the Macedonian IOI team in 2020. My trainees won [three bronze medals at the Olympiad](https://stats.ioinformatics.org/results/MKD/2020), which was the second-best performance in Macedonian history. Previously, I studied civil engineering at the Cooper Union.
